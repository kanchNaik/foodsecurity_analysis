# 🥗 Analysis of Food Security & Access in the U.S.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive data-driven exploration into food security and accessibility across the United States. By leveraging interactive data visualizations and robust data analytics tools, the study sheds light on disparities in food access, affordability, and nutrition. The goal is to empower policymakers, NGOs, and community leaders with actionable insights to make informed decisions toward improving food equity.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze food security indicators such as insufficient food consumption, food prices, and demographic-based disparities.
- Visualize food access across states and counties with respect to distance, affordability, and availability.
- Identify vulnerable populations based on income, education, disability, and employment.
- Present actionable dashboards to drive data-informed interventions and policy reforms.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- **Interactive Dashboards**: Built using Tableau for dynamic exploration of food insecurity trends.
- **ETL Pipelines**: Data was collected, cleaned, and processed using Python, Google Cloud, Trifacta DataPrep, and BigQuery.
- **Data Visualizations**: Developed with Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Tableau to communicate insights clearly.
- **Comprehensive Datasets**: Includes data on income levels, food prices, access distances, and food security indicators from trusted sources like USDA and the U.S. Census Bureau.

## 📁 Data Sources

- **USDA Food Price Outlook**
- **USDA Food Access Research Atlas**
- **U.S. Census Bureau (Income Reports)**
- **ERS Food Security Data**

---

## 📈 Dashboards

- **Income & Disparity Trends**
- **Food Prices: Fresh vs Processed**
- **Food Access by Distance & Vehicle Availability**
- **Food Insecurity by Demographic Factors**

---

## 🔍 Insights & Findings

- Southern U.S. states show the highest food insecurity levels.
- Income inequality and vehicle access strongly correlate with food accessibility.
- Individuals with disabilities and some college-educated groups unexpectedly exhibit higher food insecurity.
- Fresh foods are generally more affordable than processed alternatives, yet access varies regionally.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Data limited up to the year 2022.
- The study focuses on U.S. regions and may not generalize globally.
- Some food security factors (e.g., cultural preferences) were not fully explored.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Integrating more recent datasets and satellite imagery for real-time food access mapping.
- Expanding analysis to the city and county levels for more granular insights.
- Studying food preferences across demographics to align supply with demand.
- Including machine learning models to predict future trends in food insecurity.
